            <p class="Diff">There are several differences between these two sports, including:<br>

              Field size: The field used in American football is much larger than that used in soccer. <br>
              
              Equipment: American football players wear helmets, pads, and other protective gear, while soccer players generally only wear shin guards.<br>
              
              Scoring: Scoring in American football involves touchdowns, field goals, and extra points, while in soccer it is simply scoring a goal.<br>
              
              Time: American football is divided into quarters with stoppages in play, while soccer is played in two halves with a continuous clock.<br>
              
              Number of players: American football teams have 11 players on the field at a time, while soccer teams have 11 players on the field at a time as well.<br>
              
              Use of hands: In soccer, players are not allowed to use their hands to touch the ball (except for the goalkeeper within the designated penalty area), while in American football, players use their hands to catch and throw the ball.<br>
              
              Overall, while both sports involve a ball and two teams trying to score, they are distinct sports with different rules and playing styles</p>

            <h2>American football &#127944</h2>
            <p class="Football-Text">American football, on the other hand, is a sport where two teams of 11 players each try to advance an oval-shaped ball down a 100-yard field to score points by either carrying the ball into the opposing team's end zone or kicking it through their goalposts. The game involves physical contact between players, and is divided into four 15-minute quarters with a halftime break in between.

            <h2>British football &#9917;</h2>
            <p class="Soccer-Text">British football, commonly known as soccer, is a sport where two teams of 11 players each try to score goals by kicking a ball into the opposing team's net. The game is played on a rectangular field, with the team that scores the most goals by the end of the match declared the winner.</p>
