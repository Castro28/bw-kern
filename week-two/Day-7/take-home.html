            <p>
                For people suffering from mental health issues, emotional support animals are a great way to provide treatment and coping mechanisms. Sometimes this emotional support is necessary just to help people function normally, especially for anxiety, for depression, and for learning disabilities. An emotional support or therapy animal is not quite the same thing as a service animal, which provides physical help to its owner. A therapy animal provides emotional support only.

            Guinea pigs are social creatures who live in large communities in the wild. If you plan to get a guinea pig as an emotional support animal, then it's recommended that you have at least two of them at the same time to keep each other company. Guinea pigs also don't need to be together from birth to live in the same enclosure. As long as they are safely introduced, most cavies cohabit without any issues. Other excellent rodent alternatives to guinea pigs include a mouse, hamster, or gerbil.
